# Market_Basket_Analysis

**Introduction**

This repo contains the code implementation for the algorithms of market basket analysis.
The implementation includes apriori and frequent pattern growth algorithm. These algorithms
can be readily used for determining associations between elements in a dataset based upon 
the presence of those items in the dataset.


About scripts

✅ create_dataset.py to create a dummy dataset for working of both algorithm in case the is no data available

✅ apriori.py is the implementation of apriori algorithm in functional approach

✅ Freq_pattern_growth.py is the implementation of the algorithm frequent pattern growth
